This thesis describes a loosely coupled pipeline for realtime Simultaneous Localization and Mapping(SLAM) using only monocular vision input and raw GPS data (no inertial measurement data used) onboard a fixed winged aircraft for the purpose of path planning, created in the scope of a semester project. The pipeline is based on the Direct Semi-Dense Mapping framework provided by the LSD-Slam package for keyframe based odometry and depth map generation. Raw GPS data is incorporated into the SLAM pipeline through the factor-graph optimization framework provided by the GTSAM package to recover metric scale and true global position and orientation of the generated pointcloud. \\
Direct featureless photometric alignment coupled with short-baseline stereo is used to generate a pose graph of keyframes with associated depth and variance, connected via Sim3 transition edges incorporating both scale and pose transformation between the keyframes. Robust error norms are used on the Sim3 transition edges to supress the effect of outliers in the optimization. GPS measurements are used to tag each keyframe with their global position estimate as obtained from the raw GPS data with it's associated uncertainty. The thus created graph with GPS and visual odometry factors is optimized to obtain the global pose and scale estimate of each keyframe and it's associated depth map.\\
The pipeline is run on a standard PC as a node in the ROS framework, and was tested offline using data that was previously recorded in AtlanticSolarâ€™s flight over Marche-en-Famenne, Belgium as a part of ICRAUS field trials.
